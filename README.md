# Ages of Darkness

AoD is a 2d mmorpg. It is heavily inspired from
[Darkages](http://darkages.com).
Some key differences from Darkages will be full loot and
zero pvp safe zones. This means anywhere in the world
you can and will die and when that happens what ever is being
carried will be dropped on the ground. Another key difference
will be local banking. Meaning, if an item is put inside a container
it can only be withdrawn from the same container. This mechanic
will localize resource collection and moving resources to
another location in the world will have an associated risk
involved because of full loot.

## Leveling and Character development

### Stats

Characters in AoD will have very minimalist statistic
growth. The reason for this is to reduce the time necessary
to for a character to become competitively viable. In AoD,
the main factor in your success is your own mechanical and
tactical skills.

### Skills

In AoD your character will have access to a limited number
of skills from the entire pool of available skills. For example
if the skill limit is set to 3 and the total available skills
are

- Charge
- Self heal
- Fireball
- Blink
- Push

your character could have a skill set comprised of any combination
of 3 skills.

- Charge
- Fireball
- Blink

or

- Blink
- Self heal
- Push

These skill sets can be changed at any time, but will have a long
cast time(10-20 seconds) making the character vulnerable to attack
during that period.

## World Building

The main development focus in AoD will the collection of resources
from the world and using those resources to build armor, weapons,
and other items for use by the players. Resources will also be used
to modify the world by building structures and scuplting the terrain.
By building structures the players will be able to build homes for
themselves, cities, and hopefully some form of cooperative civilization.

### Plot Arc

The world is AoD will be influenced by the prescence of implicitly
benevolent and malnevolent entities. These, Big Good's and Big Bad's
will be in constant turmoil and will be the main source of conflict
in the game. If either entity is destroyed the game will be over and
a new world will be created for the players to reshape.

### Long Term Persistence

You may ask, If the world is remade over and over and I lose everything
I worked towards, why should I play? The answer is that the history,
or the Legend, of every character you've ever played will be saved
for all to see and admire. With each reset you will be given a new
chance to create a different roleplaying experience for your self
and others.
