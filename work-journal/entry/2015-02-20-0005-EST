# journal - WIP collision detection & resolution
Very happy with the design work I've completed today on engine.
Everything is in place to now begin building a map,
collision detection, skill, spells, everything.
Theres lots of difficult things laying ahead for
this project but I'm exciting about tackling these
new problems.
