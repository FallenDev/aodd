# journal - Frustrated with JS
After working for the past 5 weeks entirely in go,
using amazing tools like gorename and goinfo I am struggling with
working in the JS environment. It is a 100% awful experience in
comparison. Really isn't much else to it. I'm going to have to
re-write all the JS in Go using gopherjs. Otherwise I'm going
to continue to write untested, get it done JS code that I hate.
