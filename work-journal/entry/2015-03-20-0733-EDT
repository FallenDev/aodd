# journal - Bug fixes, More bugs and fluidity
Last evening I fixed the, you can log in as the same
actor and everything seems to be working and then the
server panic's and dies bug. I made an attempt to solve
it before my presentation, but that was too little time.
It took around 4-5 hours to actually implement the test
and impl, but while I was working through it I found
another corner case that I needed to handle.

Theres all kinds of bugs when the players viewport overlaps
the edges of the world. Something about invalid indices. Though
the good news is that is appears to be all client side bugs.
This makes lots of sense.

Immediate problems that should be looked at fixing are the
fluidity of assail and charge. The NPC and walled arena
can be added in parallel to fixing the avoid to UX issues.
