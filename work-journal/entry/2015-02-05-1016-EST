# journal - Plan going forward
After looking over the old client implementation last night I think
I am not going to worry about a react rewrite. I'm also a little
on the fence about changing much of current way you name yourself.
I don't know how I want to go about attaching characters to accounts
or anything really. I'm a mess, I don't know what I'm doing or how
to move forward.

I could use the DA model and just have characters with passwords.
A real player could attach characters to their accounts later.
This could streamline the new player experience a little.
I do want redo the initial interface presented to the user.
This is my chance to play with react.

I wonder if I should move the character creation and login
away from the websocket connection to an http post. No no,
I shouldn't do that because actors also need to auth over
udp in the future for a native client. Do it over the socket
then the code is reused for free and adding udp support to
the server will be easy.
